/*! @mainpage OpenCTM API Reference
 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * OpenCTM is an open file format for storing compressed triangle meshes.
 * In order to easily read and write OpenCTM files (usually suffixed .ctm) an
 * API (Application Program Interface) is provided that can easily be used from
 * most modern programming languages.
 *
 * The OpenCTM functionality itself is written in highly portable standard C
 * (C99).
 *
 * @section usage_sec Usage
 *
 * For information about how to use the OpenCTM API, see openctm.h.
 *
 * For information about the C++ wrapper classes, see CTMimporter and
 * CTMexporter.
 *
 * @section example_sec Example usage
 *
 * @subsection example_load_sec Loading a CTM file
 *
 * Here is a simple example of loading a CTM file:
 *
 * @code
 *   CTMcontext context;
 *   CTMuint    vertCount, triCount, * indices;
 *   CTMfloat   * vertices;
 *
 *   // Create a new context
 *   context = ctmNewContext(CTM_IMPORT);
 *
 *   // Load the OpenCTM file
 *   ctmLoad(context, "mymesh.ctm");
 *   if(ctmGetError(context) == CTM_NONE)
 *   {
 *     // Access the mesh data
 *     vertCount = ctmGetInteger(context, CTM_VERTEX_COUNT);
 *     vertices = ctmGetFloatArray(context, CTM_VERTICES);
 *     triCount = ctmGetInteger(context, CTM_TRIANGLE_COUNT);
 *     indices = ctmGetIntegerArray(context, CTM_INDICES);
 *
 *     // Deal with the mesh (e.g. transcode it to our internal representation)
 *     // ...
 *   }
 *
 *   // Free the context
 *   ctmFreeContext(context);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @subsection example_create_sec Creating a CTM file
 *
 * Here is a simple example of creating a CTM file:
 *
 * @code
 *   CTMcontext context;
 *   CTMuint    vertCount, triCount, * indices;
 *   CTMfloat   * vertices;
 *
 *   // Create our mesh in memory
 *   vertCount = 100;
 *   triCount = 120;
 *   vertices = (CTMfloat *) malloc(3 * sizeof(CTMfloat) * vertCount);
 *   indices = (CTMuint *) malloc(3 * sizeof(CTMuint) * triCount);
 *   // ...
 *
 *   // Create a new context
 *   context = ctmNewContext(CTM_EXPORT);
 *
 *   // Define our mesh representation to OpenCTM (store references to it in
 *   // the context)
 *   ctmDefineMesh(context, vertices, vertCount, indices, triCount, NULL);
 *
 *   // Save the OpenCTM file
 *   ctmSave(context, "mymesh.ctm");
 *
 *   // Free the context
 *   ctmFreeContext(context);
 *
 *   // Free our mesh
 *   free(indices);
 *   free(vertices);
