# Welcome to the MeshLib!
3D scanning is becoming more and more ubiquitous. Robotic automation, self-driving cars and multitude of other industrial, medical and scientific applications require advanced computer vision to deliver the levels of automation customers expect these days. The great rise of AI gave another boost to computer vision and the need to utilize 3D data to make machines smarter. Not only are tasks at hand becoming more complex, but the size of data grows exponentially. 

There is a multitude of general purpose libraries which deal with 3D data. Some stem from popular CAD packages, some are open source. The commercial ones tend to be quite expensive while open source are free though tend to be limited in functionality provided. Also those libraries value generality above other features  to allow maximum number of applications, but with the growing amounts of 3D data, performance is critical as it never has  been. Some of it can be addressed by using the scale of a commercial cloud, last generation CPU or GPU but underlying complexity of data representation makes it very hard and laborsome.

The goal which we set when designing MeshLib was to value simplicity and performance while providing a wide gamut of useful computational algorithms. The library also supports the most important data structures today’s sensors can produce - pointcloud, mesh, volume and more. For example, mesh is represented by half-edge data structure and cannot be made non-manifold. Some applications may require non-manifoldness, but most practical scans can be represented as manifoldness meshes without an issue.

## Major features
This list is not full and updating each day
### Math basics
 - Math primitives and operations support (Vectors 2D, 3D, 4D; Lines; Planes; Bounding Boxes; Matrices; Affine transformations; Quaternions; Histograms; etc.)
### 3D data handling, creation, modification
 - 3D data various representations support: Mesh, Voxel and Point Cloud.

 - Splitting
   - Splitting mesh into sub-meshes (components)
### 3D data operations
 - Boolean operations (union, intersection, difference) on 3D objects bounded by meshes. MeshLib has two independent modes:
   1. Boolean ops on meshes via intermediate conversion into voxel representation. This mode requires closed meshes without holes on input and much memory for high accuracy but tolerate for various input mesh degenerations and self-intersections.
   2. Direct Boolean ops on meshes using robust predicates, producing exact accurate result and keeping original mesh elements as is if they are not intersected. This mode supports for open meshes with holes as long as the boundary of the mesh is not intersected.
      - According to our user reports, MeshLib direct Boolean operations are significatly faster even compared to the latest published approaches, e.g. [Interactive and Robust Mesh Booleans](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14151.pdf)
 - Construction of Convex Hull of a point cloud or a mesh.
### 3D Data problems fixing
 - Fixing holes in mesh
   - Holes stitching (removing two holes by stitching their boundaries) 
   - Hole filling,
   - Holes fixing metrics
      - Basic set of triangulation metrics,
      - Extended set of triangulation metrics,
      - Custom triangulation metrics.
 - Delaunay triangulation optimization, changing triangles without changing vertices, according to Delaunay criterion,
 - Tunnels fixing,
 - Multiple edges detection

# Python integration

Although MeshLib is written in C++, all functions are exposed to Python as well. Python code can be executed both from within a MeshLib-based C++ application (embedded mode) and from python interpreter directly, which imports MeshLib modules.

Moreover, the latest MeshLib released version can be easily installed as a Python 3.8 - 3.12 package using `pip install`:

Latest version of meshlib in python has almost all c++ functionality, but also can have slightly different signatures from old versions. One can install it if specify version explicitly `pip install meshlib==3.0.0.40`  
> **_NOTE:_** we have no available Python3.8 package on macOS x86
* On Windows via
```
py -3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
py -3 -m pip install --upgrade meshlib
```
* On Linuxes supporting [manylinux_2_31+](https://github.com/mayeut/pep600_compliance#distro-compatibility), including Ubuntu 20+ and Fedora 32+ via
```
sudo apt install python3-pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade meshlib
```
* On macOS 12.0+ via
```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade meshlib
```

See Python Basic Examples [here](https://meshlib.io/documentation/HowToBasic.html) or search for more complex ones on [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/).

- Specify the target .NET version. Minimal supported versions are .NET Framework 4.7.1 and .NET 6.
- Right-click on your project in Solution Explorer and select *Manage NuGet Packages*
- Select *nuget.org* as package source
- Go to the *Browse* tab and type "MeshLib" in the *Search* field
- Select MeshLib package and press the *Install* button

## Installation of downloaded .nupkg file
- Open [NuGet website](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MeshLib/)
- Click on *Download package*
You can download  containing dynamic lybraries (.dll) of both MeshLib and dependant third-party libraries, and make them available during your project building and runtime execution as follows.
- Alternative: download [a NuGet package from GitHub](https://github.com/MeshInspector/MeshLib/releases)
- In Visual Studio go to Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Settings
- Proceed to the *Package Sources* tab
- Look which directory is used for Microsoft Visual Studio Offline Packages
- Copy the downloaded package to that directory
- Create a new .NET Project as described above
- In the *Manage NuGet Packages* dialog select *Microsoft Visual Studio Offline Packages* as package source
- Select MeshLib package and press the *Install* button

> **_NOTE:_** MeshLib package is built for x64 architecture, so make sure that your solution platform is x64. Correct working for other platforms is not guaranteed.

# Build
## Windows
MeshLib can be build on Windows using either Visual Studio 2019 or Visual Studio 2022, both of which support c++20 language standard. 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/MeshInspector/MeshLib.git
cd MeshLib
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd ..
```
Note: following below steps will take about 40Gb of your disk space.

### Preparing Third Parties
Some third parties are taken from vcpkg, while others (missing in vcpkg) are configured as git submodules.

### CUDA
Windows version of MeshLib is configured to use 
* CUDA v11.4 in Visual Studio 2019 and
* CUDA v12.0 in Visual Studio 2022.
  
Please install CUDA from the [official site](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive).
If you would like to use another version of CUDA, please modify `MRCudaVersion` in `MeshLib/source/platform.props`.

### Vcpkg
1. Please install `vcpkg`, and integrate it into Visual Studio (note that vcpkg requires English language pack in Visual Studio, and vcpkg cannot be installed on FAT volumes, only on NTFS):
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
    cd vcpkg
    git checkout 2024.10.21
    .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
    .\vcpkg integrate install (with admin rights)
    ```
    More details here: [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).

2. (Optional, but recommended) Install [AWS CLI v2](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi). Once installed, reopen PowerShell or CMD. This will allow you to use the vcpkg binary cache from our aws s3, which will speed up the installation process and reduce the required disk space.

3. Execute `MeshLib/thirdparty/install.bat` having previously installed `vcpkg` as the current working directory (or simply add `vcpkg` to `PATH` environment variable).
    
4. Open solution file `MeshLib/source/MeshLib.sln` in Visual Studio. Build it and run.

## Linux

We regularly check that MeshLib can be built successfully on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (both x64 and ARM), and Fedora 37.

**Install/Build dependencies. Build project. Run Test Application**

Install CUDA v12.0 from [official site](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive)

Use automated installation process. It takes ~40 minutes if no required packages are already installed.
This approach is useful for new MR developers

Run the following in terminal:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/MeshInspector/MeshLib.git
cd MeshLib
./scripts/build_thirdparty.sh  # do not select emscripten in the corresponding question
./scripts/build_source.sh  # do not select emscripten in the corresponding question
# create and install package for Ubuntu
./scripts/distribution.sh
sudo apt install ./distr/meshlib-dev.deb
# create and install package for Fedora
./scripts/distribution_rpm.sh
sudo apt install ./distr/meshlib-dev.rpm
```

> **_NOTE:_** `./scripts/install*.sh` scripts could be used as well, but apt install is preferable.

> **_NOTE:_** `./scripts/install_thirdparty.sh` script copies MR files directly to `/usr/local/lib`. Remove this directory manually if exists before apt install deb package.

> **_NOTE:_** You could specify build type to Debug by `export MESHLIB_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`. Release is default. Set `MESHLIB_KEEP_BUILD=ON` to suppress full rebuild


## WASM/Emscripten
This installation was checked on Ubuntu 22.04 with Emscripten 3.1.48.

Install Emscripten (find more on [Emscripten official page](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html))
```
git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
cd emsdk
git pull origin # optional
./emsdk install 3.1.48 # (or another version / latest)
./emsdk activate 3.1.48
source ./emsdk_env.sh
```

Build
```
cd ~/MeshLib
./scripts/build_thirdparty.sh # select Emscripten in the corresponding question
./scripts/build_source.sh # select Emscripten in the corresponding question
```
> **_NOTE:_** Set `MESHLIB_KEEP_BUILD=ON` to suppress full rebuild

Run
```
python3 -m http.server 8000 # note that server should have specific COEP and COOP policies for multithread version
# open in browser 127.0.0.1:8000
```

# Integration

## Linux Ubuntu/Fedora
You can download [dev package](https://github.com/MeshInspector/MeshLib/releases) and install it with your Linux OS package manager. 
Examples of integration with cmake can be found in the `./examples` directory.


## MacOS
Same as for Linux, but requires brew packages to be installed:
```
xargs brew install < /Library/Frameworks/MeshLib.framework/Versions/Current/requirements/macos.txt
```


## Windows
There are two general options of integrating MeshLib into your project:
1. [Submodule](#submodule)
2. [Distribution](#distribution)

### Submodule

You can have MeshLib as submodule in your repository, and inculde all MeshLib's projects to your solution.

This option requires you to [install third-party libraries](#vcpkg) via `vcpkg` package mananger.

> **_NOTE:_** You should use `MeshLib/source/common.props` in other projects of your solution.

> **_NOTE:_** You can customize props by defining `CustomMRProps.props` in directory above `common.props`.

> **_NOTE:_** If you would like to set `_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL=1` macro, then please do it in `CustomMRProps.props` together with `MR_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL=1` macro.

### Distribution
You can download [zip-archive](https://github.com/MeshInspector/MeshLib/releases) containing 
* header files (.h),
* library archives (.lib),
* dynamic libraries (.dll)

of both MeshLib and dependant third-party libraries, and make them available during your project building and runtime execution as follows.

Project settings in Visual Studio:
1. `C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories` add `distribution\install\include;`
2. `Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories` add `distribution\install\app\$(Configuration);`
3. `Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies` add `distribution\install\lib\$(Configuration)\*.lib;`
4. Debug Configuration: `C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Defenitions` add `_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL=0;`

Make sure you copy all dlls from `distribution\install\app\$(Configuration);` to your `$(TargetDir)`
> **_NOTE:_** MeshLib distribution has x64 build only.

> **_NOTE:_** Distribution is built with `_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL=0` macro defined in Debug configuration so you will need to setup this for your projects.
