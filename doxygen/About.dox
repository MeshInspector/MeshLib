## Welcome to MeshLibâ€™s documentation!
The MeshLib SDK is an open-source 3D geometry processing library designed to provide developers with a comprehensive toolkit for building robust 3D applications. 
Whether you are working in C++, Python, or C#, MeshLib offers a versatile, cross-platform solution available on Windows, macOS, and Linux, enabling the development of cutting-edge solutions with ease and precision.

## Key Features

 - \b 3D \b Data \b Handling: Supports meshes, voxels, and point clouds for creation, modification, and conversion.
 - \b Boolean \b Operations: Fast, highly optimized mesh and voxel-based approaches.
 - \b Mesh \b Fixing: Includes removing self-intersections, filling holes, and component separation.
 - \b Simplification \b & \b Subdivision: Optimize mesh complexity with decimation, remeshing, and subdivision.
 - \b Offsets: Multiple modes for precise surface thickness control, ideal for 3D printing and machining.
 - \b Triangulation: Accurate, fast conversion of point clouds to meshes with normal creation.
 - \b ICP: Precise mesh alignment using point-to-point and point-to-plane transformations.
 - \b Segmentation: Semi-automatic segmentation based on curvature for meshes and voxels.
 - \b Deformations: Supports Laplacian, freeform, and relax smoothing for fine mesh adjustments.
 - \b Distance \b Maps \b & \b Polylines: Generate distance maps, iso-lines, and perform projection and intersection.
