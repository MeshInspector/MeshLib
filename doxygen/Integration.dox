/** \page Integration Integration

\section Windows

There are two general options of integrating MeshLib into your project: \n
1. Submodule
2. Distribution

\b Common \b for \b both \b options: \n
Please install vcpkg, and integrate it into Visual Studio (note that vcpkg requires English language pack in Visual Studio, and vcpkg cannot be installed on FAT volumes, only on NTFS):
\code
$ git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
$ cd vcpkg
$ git checkout 5c54cc06554e450829d72013c4b9e4baae41529a
$ .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
$ .\vcpkg integrate install (with admin rights)
$ cd ..
\endcode
More details here: [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)
2. Copy \b MeshLib/thirdparty/vcpkg/triplets/x64-windows-meshlib.cmake  to \b vcpkg/triplets folder of vcpkg installation.
3. Execute install.bat
\code
$ cd vcpkg # or add vcpcg to PATH
$ ../MeshLib/thirdparty/install.bat
\endcode

\b Submodule: \n
You can have MeshLib as submodule in your repository, and inculde all MeshLib's projects to your solution.
\parblock
\note You should use `MeshLib/source/common.props` in other projects of your solution.
\endparblock
\parblock
\note You can customize props by defining `CustomMRProps.props` in directory above `common.props`
\endparblock

\b Distribution: \n
You can download [distribution](https://github.com/MeshInspector/MeshLib/releases) and integrate it in your projects.\n
Project settings:
1. `C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories` add `distribution\install\include;`
2. `Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories` add `distribution\install\app\$(Configuration);`
3. `Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies` add `distribution\install\lib\$(Configuration)\*.lib;`
4. Debug: `C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Defenitions` add `_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL=0;`
5. 'vcpkg -> Triplet' set `x64-windows-meshlib`

Make sure you copy all dlls from `distribution\install\app\$(Configuration);` to your `$(TargetDir)`
\parblock
\note MeshLib distribution has x64 build only
\endparblock
\parblock
\note Distribution is build with ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL=0 in debug so you will need to setup this for your projects
\endparblock

\section Linux Ubuntu/Fedora
You can download [dev package](https://github.com/MeshInspector/MeshLib/releases) and install it with your Linux OS package manager. Examples of integration with cmake can be found in the `./examples` directory.

\section MacOS
Same as for Linux, but requires brew packages to be installed:
`xargs brew install < /Library/Frameworks/MeshLib.framework/Versions/Current/requirements/macos.txt`
