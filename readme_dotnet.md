**Key Features:**

- **3D Data Handling:** Supports meshes, voxels, and point clouds for creation, modification, analysis, and conversion between data representations.
- **Boolean Operations:** Fast, highly optimized mesh- and voxel-based boolean operations for precise unions, subtractions, and intersections.
- **Mesh Fixing:** Automatically detect and repair self-intersections, fill holes, and separate connected components to restore valid geometry.
- **Simplification & Subdivision:** Reduce or refine mesh complexity using decimation, remeshing, and subdivision while preserving critical details.
- **Offsets:** Multiple offset modes for precise surface thickness control, ideal for 3D printing, machining, and manufacturing workflows.
- **Triangulation:** Accurate and high-performance conversion of point clouds to meshes, including robust normal generation.
- **ICP Alignment:** Precise mesh and point cloud alignment using point-to-point and point-to-plane ICP transformations.
- **Inspection Tools:** Fast deviation comparison, distance analysis, and measurement tools for inspection and quality control.
