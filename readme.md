# MeshLib: An SDK to Supercharge Your 3D Data Processing Efficiency

Official Website: [**https://meshlib.io**](https://meshlib.io/) 

The MeshLib SDK is an open-source library that provides advanced algorithms for 3D data processing. It assists developers and engineers in achieving precise results while delivering significant resource savings. Whether you are working on 3D printing, scanning, inspection, automation, robotics, scientific visualization, or medical devices, our 3D data processing library is ideally suited to meet your needs thanks to its potent capabilities and broad applicability.

## Why Choose Us

**Fully Open Source.** You can also fork the code for your own unique use cases.

**Multi-Language Support.** Written in C++ with bindings for C, C#, and Python, our library integrates easily into AI pipelines and workflows.

**High Performance.** Internal benchmarks show up to 10x faster execution compared to alternative SDKs — especially in mesh boolean operations and simplification. [See performance data](https://meshlib.io/blog/).

**GPU-Accelerated Architecture.** Built with speed and scalability in mind, MeshLib supports GPU acceleration and CUDA for high-performance computing.

**Cross-Platform Ready.** The SDK runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and WebAssembly, offering flexibility for any development environment.

**Developer Support.** Get timely assistance from our responsive support team for integration, usage, or troubleshooting.

**Flexible Integration.** Use our toolkit as a standalone engine with UI components, or integrate selected algorithms into existing applications with minimal dependencies.

## What We Offer

We provide a robust foundation for 3D data processing, supporting all essential formats like point clouds, meshes, and volumes continuously generated by modern sensors. Our powerful half-edge data structure ensures manifold compliance for precise, reliable mesh representation. Plus, our repository includes clear code samples to help you get started quickly and explore advanced features with ease.

## Key Available Algorithms

- **3D Boolean** performs fast, highly optimized mesh- and voxel-based operations.
- **Mesh Repair** eliminates self-intersections, fills holes, and removes degeneracies.
- **Mesh Offsetting** controls surface thickness with multiple precise modes for 3D printing and machining.
- **Hole Filling** fills flat and curved surfaces, connects or separates holes, and builds bridges.
- **Mesh Simplification** optimizes mesh complexity while keeping details within set tolerance. We provide remeshing, and subdivision options as well.
- **Collision Detection** verifies intersections between models for further operations.
- **Extensive File Format Support** enables importing a wide range of file formats for meshes, point clouds, CT scans, polylines, distance maps, and G-code. Export functionalities—and support for color and texture data—are available for select formats, too (see the [full list for details](https://meshlib.io/feature/file-formats-supported-by-meshlib/)).
- **Triangulation** converts point clouds into meshes with accurate normal creation.
- **ICP** precisely aligns meshes using point-to-point and point-to-plane transformations.
- **Segmentation** performs semi-automatic segmentation based on curvature for meshes and voxels.
- **Deformation** applies Laplacian, freeform, and relaxation smoothing for fine mesh adjustments.
- **Support of Distance Maps and Polylines** allows to generate distance maps and iso-lines and performs projection and intersection.
